# Help about this site

This website provides information about a number of applications and their status with regards to running on Windows on Arm.

Applications are grouped by category and an application can be classified by more than one category. To see the applications for a given category, select the category from the **Categories** links on an application page or from the Category drop-down menu found to the right of the search bar.

For each application, there is a **Compatibility** field that can be one of the following values:

| Value     | Meaning                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |

| unknown   | status not known                      |

The **Version From** field shows the publicly available version that provides the above stated level of support.

The **Link** field takes you to the main website for this application.
